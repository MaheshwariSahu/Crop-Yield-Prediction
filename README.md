## Crop-Yield-Prediction
ðŸŒ± Crop Yield Prediction

This project focuses on predicting crop yield using machine learning techniques.
This project predicts crop yield (hg/ha) using rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and crop type data across different countries and years. The goal is to provide insights for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and sustainable farming practices.

The dataset contains 28,242 records with the following features:

Column	Description
Area	Country/Region where crop is grown

Item	Crop type (Maize, Potatoes, Rice, etc.)

Year	Year of observation

hg/ha_yield	Crop yield (Target Variable, in hectograms per hectare)

average_rain_fall_mm_per_year	Average annual rainfall (mm)

pesticides_tonnes	Total pesticide usage (tonnes)

avg_temp	Average annual temperature (Â°C)
